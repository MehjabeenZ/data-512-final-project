# Project Part 4: Final Report

This repository contains the data files, code and results of the final project for the course Data 512: Human Centered Data Science at the University of Washington's MS in Data Science program. 

## Goal of Project
In recent years, the western United States has been experiencing increasingly severe wildfires, resulting in widespread smoke that affects multiple states. While the causes of these wildfires are debated, including factors like climate change and forestry policies, their impact is undeniable. 

This project focuses on assessing how wildfires impact Gillette, Wyoming, with the ultimate objective of providing valuable insights to policymakers, city administrators, and local authorities. By understanding these impacts, they can make informed decisions on how to prepare for and mitigate the consequences of future wildfires.
